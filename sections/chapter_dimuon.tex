\section{The Search Channels}
Two different search channels and is employed. In the 40-75 GeV region, the inclusive dimuon signal will be searched for. This is the inclusive channel of the analysis. In the 10-40 GeV of the analysis, a boosted channel will be used for the analysis. 
In the lower mass range, the boosted channel strategy is employed n view of the trigger turn on feature near 30 GeV in the background resonance mass distribution (See Figure~\ref{fig:turnon}), a boosted dimuon signal with ISR is searched for. In this channel, a cut of dimuon $P_{T}>14 GeV$ is applied to both the signal and the background. This cut retains a signal efficiency of >90\% in the boosted channel and produces a smooth background. This strategy is effective in evading the effect of the trigger turn on and the background can be estimated with smooth background prediction procedures. 
The two channel treatment is based on a pheno-study first done here\cite{2014}. Figure~\ref{fig:turnon} shows the background distribution of the MC in the boosted and the inclusive channel.

\section{Signal Theoretical Model}
The analysis uses the dark matter LHC benchmark model and dark photon model outlined in Section~\ref{sec:LHCDM} of Chapter~\ref{chapter:DM}.
Other models that are of interest and can be reinterpreted for this analysis includes the W\', the quantum blackholes,and axion models.

\section{Data preparation}
The final result of the strategies presented in this chapter are collected from proton-proton collision data during the ATLAS Run 2 period at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{13} TeV$ from 2016-2018. The preliminary strategy of this chapter is generated from ATLAS full simulation Monte Carlo. Due the process\'s low statistics in the ATLAS full simulation, a full size Z $\rightarrow \mu \mu$ sample is created through a fast Sherpa and PYTHIA8 combination generation at the truth level, where $P_{T}$ smearing is applied for detector effect. Section~\ref{section:superfast} details the superfast event generation.

\end{table}

In addition to sources in this table, QCD fakes that may contribute to background events are estimated by same-signed dimuon pairs in data that satistfy all other event requirements. The rational is that in data all of the same-signed dimuon would all come from QCD contribution, and that the contribution amount would be equal to the opposite-signed contribution from QCD. Figure~\ref{} shows a background composition plot with the same signed contribution subtracted out. The fake QCD contribution makes up less than 1\% of all the events. After the application of the Fake estimation, the overall agreement between data and MC in controlled regions are within acceptable range, it shows that the MC is ready to be used for statistics strategy studies.

In the analysis, 2 muons of the \textbf{\textit{MEDIUM}} working point and the \textbf{\textit{FixedCutPFlowLoose}} isolation working point (Defined in Chapter~\ref{chapter:common_analysis_items}) are required for each of the events chosen. In addition, $|\eta|< 2.5$ is required for both muons.

%    \end{center}
%\end{figure}

%\subsection{Event Selection}
%Following the above trigger cuts, the following event selections are made on the muons:
%
%\subsubsection*{Muon Working Point}
%The medium working point is chosen for the muons, details to the working point can be found here: 
%
%The choice is made on the medium working point over low PT, as the trigger threshold effectively cut out most muons below 8GeV. The Low PT working point only has a higher efficiency over the medium working point below  6 GeV. 

%\subsubsection*{Isolation Working Point}
%FixedCutPflowLoose is chosen to be the isolation working point, details on the working point description can be found here:~\ref{}. 

%\subsubsection{Fake Estimation}
%Fakes are objects that are not opposite signed dimuon pairs that falls into the selection requirement in data event selection due to misidentifications.
%Since the fakes mainly comes from QCD ATLAS processes, the amount from same signed process and opposite signed process are approximately the same. 
%Fakes in the background sample can be estimated from the same signed leptons in data. Studies found that the content is less than 1\% of all the background contribution. The estimated same signed leptons contribution is added to the MC background composition.

\subsubsection{Superfast Dimuon Samples}
\label{section:superfast}
Due to the low statistics in the primary background sample in  $Z \> \mu \mu$, fast generation relying on Pythia8 and a smearing function for the detector effect has been used to emulate the statistical fluctuation of the full dataset. Four different variation of the superfast statistics as been used, each uses a different pdf set for the generator tuning. The Nominal set uses the ATLAS A14 NNPDF2.3LO; the down variation and up variation uses the variation tune parameters Var3C listed
here~\ref{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021}; whereas the $\eta$ variation uses ATLAS A15 NNPDF2.3 along with QCD and QED NLO. More details on the fast simulation can be found here~\ref{}.

\subsection{Dimuon Mass Spectrum Resolution}
The mass spectrum resolution are done on the Powheg samples of Z > $\mu \mu
$. A Gaussian distribution fit is performed on the resonance mass $m_{\mu\mu_{Truth}} - m_{\mu\mu{Reco}}$ quantity. From the fit, the width of the Gaussian is obtained~\ref{fig:fit}, and is shown to follow the following distribution in figure~\ref{fig:sigma}.

    \end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Binning Strategy}
Using the resolution of the study from the last section and the mass distribution given in the theoretical signal section, the overall binning is chosen to be 0.25 GeV, it will allow for all signal searched for to be at least 2 bin wide. Signal that are at least two bin wide are significantly less prone to accidental "discoveries" due to statistical fluctuation.
%\subsubsection{MC/Data Comparison}

%The agreement is shown to be good between the prepared MC and data. It shows that the MC is ready to be used for the subsequent tests.

\section{Background Fitting}
As there is not enough fully simulated ATLAS MC for estimating the background nor are the shape of the MC template reliable to be scaled up for background estimation, the background fitting of the dimuon analysis relies on a data driven approach. The background fitting method of the analysis uses the Gaussian Process approach outlined in Chapter~\ref{chapter:analysismethod}. Details specific to the analysis is described here.

\subsection{The Kernel}
In Gaussian Process, the mean function and the covariance function that describe the variance on the prediction can be determined by the kernel function along with the training data pointsu(See details in Chapter~\ref{}.)

The Gaussian process background and signal kernels used for this particular analysis method is given here:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Background Kernel} \textit{-``Radial Basis Function + White Noise Kernel"}
        \begin{equation}
                K_{bkg}(x, x') = A_{1} * exp(-\frac{||x-x'||}{2\sigma^{2}}) 
        \label{eq:backgroundkernel}
        \end{equation}

    Here, $A_{1}$ is the amplitude hyperparameter that describes the size of the kernel, $\sigma_{1}$ is the lengthscale parameter.
\item \textbf{Signal Kernel} \textit{- ``Exponential Center Kernel + White Noise Kernel "}
            \begin{equation}
            K(x_{i}, x_{j})=A_{2}\cdot exp(-(x-m)^{2}/(2\cdot\sigma_{2}^{2}))\cdot exp(-((x'-m)^{2}/(2\cdot\sigma_{2}^{2})))
            \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

    Here, $A_{2}$ is the amplitude of the signal kernel, m is the value where the kernel peaked on, and $\sigma_{2}$ is the lengthscale of the signal kernel. 

\subsection{Hyperparameter Optimization}
The detailed steps to the hyper-parameter optimization can be found in Chapter~\ref{chapter:analysismethod}.

As the lengthscale in both the background and signal kernel would lead to lost of sensitivity and overfitting of data, they are chosen through the signal injection test described in Section~\ref{sec:signalinjection} and the binning studies in Section~\ref{sec:binning} respectively. The other hyper-parameters are allow to float and are optimized through the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm.  

Background kernel fits are performed on different variation of the fast simulation MC to ensure the selected hyper-parameters are flexible enough for the variation in shape in MC. Figure~\ref{} shows fitting result in the inclusive region of the MC using the background kernel listed in ~\ref
{}.

\subsection{Background and Signal Estimation}
Studies found that the background estimation from the background kernel alone was not able to separate the background from the signal to a high efficiency, the final background and signal estimation are done through the following separation equations. Figure~\ref{fig:signalseparation} shows an example separation done by the method.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Background Prediction}
    \begin{equation}
        \mu_{bkg}(x_{*}|y) = \mu_{\textrm{bkg kernel}}(x_{*}|y)+K_{\textrm{bkg kernel}}(x_{*}, x) \cdot K_{\textrm{sig+bkg kernel}}(x,x') \cdot( y(x)-\mu_{\textrm{bkg kernel}}(x_{*}|y) )
    \end{equation}


    \item \textbf{Signal Prediction}
    \begin{equation}
        \mu_{sig}(x_{*}|y) = K_{\textrm{sig kernel}}(x_{*}, x)\cdot K_{\textrm{sig+bkg kernel}}(x,x') \cdot ( y(x)-\mu_{\textrm{bkg kernel}}(x_{*}|y) )
    \end{equation}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Background Prediction Performance}
The Gaussian Process background prediction went through testing suggested in the ATLAS smoothing recommendation document to ensure the smooth background procedure is valid for resonance searches. Two tests, the signal injection test and the spurious signal test are conducted to ensure the background estimation is sensitive to signal above a certain size and the background error is within acceptable range of the estimation. The following subsection shows the results using background prediction on ATLAS background MC.  

\subsubsection{Signal injection test} 
\textit{-``“Test for smallest signal the background estimation is sensitive to”}
This section detailed the procedure to the signal injection test: 

Signals of different mass widths are generated from a Gaussian distribution, Poissonian noise is thrown randomly on the distribution to create pseudo signal distribution. The mass widths are chosen to be 1\%, 3\% and 5\% respectively. Signal of different scale with correpsonding error is generated and is injected to the background MC distribution.

The background error is defined by the generation of 10,000 bin-by-bin Poissonian toy from the original background MC spectrum, and refitting the toys by Gaussian Process background kernel estimation. A Gaussian fit is performed on the prediction of each bin, the resulting width of the Gaussian fit in each bin is defined to be the 1 $\sigma$ background estimation. 

Starting with the smallest signal size and the smallest width, the bumphunter procedure detailed in section~\ref{} is ran on the signal injected background MC. The signal size injected increases, until the bumphunting procedure finds a window with bumphunter statistic p-value $<$ 0.01 that a bumphunter window exclusion is triggered. The size of the signal injected right before the window exclusion triggering is the ``just below"
triggering signal size, and the signal size that triggers the window exclusion is known as the ``just above" signal size. The "just below"
window size is the largerst signal that the background estimation is not sensitive to; and the ``just above" signal size is the smallest signal that the background estimation is sensitive to. When the background kernel lengthscale is chosen to be 4 GeV, the background model is sensitive to signal 3 $\sigma$ or above in background error. 

It\'s found that a minimum lengthscale of 4 GeV is needed for the background kernel for the background model to be sensitive to signal of 3 $\sigma$ background error size and above in the 45-60 GeV range in the inclusive region. Most of the signal width used passed the test when this lengthscale is chosen.

        This figure illustrate a signal injection test performed at the mass point  }
            \label{fig:dimuonstudies}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Background Modelling}
Using the minimal lengthscale chosen for the background and allowing other hyperparameters to float, tests fits are performed on the nominal fit, and also done on the different statistical variation of the background, the 1 $\sigma$ up and 1 $\sigma$ down variation of the fast simulation Pythia, as well as the $\eta$ variation, defined in Section~\ref{}.
The fitting result shows that lengthscale chosen for Gaussian Process works well for all of these statistical variations.

\subsection{Spurious signal test}
\textit{-``Test for signal extracted from the background estimation alone"}

The spurious signal test is a test that defines the uncertainty relative to signal yield. 
Using the different variation of background only MC spectrum, a signal plus background fit is performed, the signal extracted is compared against the background error defined in the last section. The spurious signal test is considered passed if the signal extracted versus background error ratio is $<$ 0.5.
The spurious signal test results on the Gaussian process is shown here:
Currently ongoing work on is being done to further reduce the spurious signal.

\section{Statistics Testing}
Details on the statistical test can be found here~\ref{}. During the time where the thesis was written, the data was not unblinded. Monte Carlo studies were done to ensure the procedure is in place. 

\section{The Search}
The search aims to either accept or reject the null hypothesis. Details are listed in this Section~\ref{}.

An example of the search done with just the background and no signal injected is shown in Figure~\ref{}. The test statistics, including 
the loglikelihood, the $\chi^{2}$ and the bumphunter test statistics all have p-value below 0.01. No anomaly is found and the null hypothesis is accepted.

An other example of the search done with the background plus signal injected in 50 GeV. The bumphunter test statistics have p-value below 0.01. The null hypothesis is rejected. In this scenario, there could be Beyond-the-Standard-Model signal present in the data.

\section{Limit Setting}
The limit setting aims to find the upper limit for the signal strength at 95\% confidence level. In the dimuon analysis, the limit setting procedure is done through the Asimov approximation of the frequentist limits described in Chapter~\ref{}.

Preliminary limit setting based on Gaussian Process is still currently under test. Currently, the Asimov limit based on fit function is sets a preliminary limit on the background MC as shown in Figure~\ref{}, the Gaussian Process based limit is on its way to be fully implemented.

In alternative fit function limits calculated by approximation based on the fit function method is shown here, it is expected that the analysis will have comparible sensitivity to LHCb.
