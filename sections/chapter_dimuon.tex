\section{Introduction}

Owing to its unprecedented high energy, the Run 1 and early Run 2 of ATLAS have long focused on the high mass resonances searches that were not accessible to any other previous experiments. This approach has left the relatively low mass resonances that are competitive in sensitivity unexplored. In the resonance search for particle which decays into two leptons, in particular, the resonance mass region above the Z boson peak has been searched since the beginning of Run
1~\cite{Aaboud:2273892}~\cite{Dilepton2019}. However, the mass region below the Z mass peak remains uncovered to this date. Novel particles with an LHC scale observable coupling are predicted by different theoretical models, some of them are related to the dark matter models explored in Chapter~\ref{chapter:DM}.

This study shares many similar motivations as the analysis presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter:dijetISR}, in which the dark matter mediator $Z^\prime$ is projected to decay into two jets. In this analysis, dark matter mediator $Z^\prime$ also couples to leptons. Since ATLAS collides protons, there are fewer background events which produce lepton than those which produce jets, allowing ATLAS to retain events with leptons above a lower transverse momentum threshold. To avoid the quarkonium background between 4-10 GeV and the Z boson in 80 GeV, this analysis searches for resonances in the 10-68 GeV range.

This chapter presents an ongoing analysis of ATLAS. Most of the strategies have been finalized and the analysis is on its way to being unblinded. The data preparation, trigger chain, event, and object calibration that is completed and validated for the analysis is presented in Section~\ref{sec:dataprep}. The full statistical strategies, which utilize Gaussian Process as the background estimation method, are covered in Section~\ref{sec:GPresults}. The analysis utilizes data from the proton--proton collision in ATLAS
recorded at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV up to 139 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. The projected result is interesting to the theoretical community for the dark matter mediator reinterpretation as well as its constraint on signatures of many other possible models, which include quantum blackholes~\cite{QBH2008} and Z*~\cite{ZStar2008}. The result of this study is complementary to the higher mass dilepton search and is assumed to have limits comparable to the CMS~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-19-018} and LHCb~\cite{Aaij:2722971} results. This work also references previous studies done in~\cite{2014}.

\section{The Search Channels}
In the LHC, not all collision events are stored due to the limitation in processing bandwidth. Triggering is the processing and storage of selective events (See Chapter~\ref{chapter:ATLAS} for more details). Triggering introduces distortions in the distributions of the kinematic quantities. An example is the muon $P_{T}$ requirement in triggering, which produces a trigger turn-on feature in the search region as seen in the red inclusive histogram in Figure~\ref{fig:turnon}.
Non-physical features in the background can lead to difficulty in background modeling. Given this, in the dimuon analysis, two different search channels are employed. In the 40-68 GeV region, the inclusive dimuon signal as shown in ~\ref{fig:dimuonFeynmann} is searched for. In the 10-40 GeV of the analysis, an initial state radiation(ISR) signal as shown in ~\ref{fig:dimuonISRFeynmann} is hunted. Figure~\ref{fig:turnon} feature the background distributions of these two search range highlighted in blue. In the
boosted channel, an additional cut of dimuon $P_{T}>14 GeV$ is applied to the dataset. This cut produces a smooth background and retains a signal efficiency of above $90\%$ using the ISR signal. This strategy is effective in producing a background that can be modeled and maximizing the search sensitivity. 
This two-channel treatment was first proposed in Ref~\cite{2014}. Changes have been made to accommodate the increase in the center-of-mass energy of the analysis.

\section{Signal Theoretical Model}
The analysis uses the dark matter LHC benchmark model and dark photon model outlined in Section~\ref{sec:LHCDM} of Chapter~\ref{chapter:DM}.
Limit setting on generic Gaussian shapes of various width will enable reinterpreations for other models.
Figure~\ref{fig:dimuonFeynmann} and Figure~\ref{fig:dimuonISRFeynmann} show the Feynman diagrams of the signal used for the analysis.
The signal MC is generated through ATLAS full simulation: the tree level event is generated through Madgraph5\_aMC@NLO~\cite{MG2014}; the parton showering is simulated through Pythia8~\cite{PYTHIA2008} and detector effect is modelled with Geant4~\cite{agostinelli2003geant4}. More details on the MC generation of ATLAS can be found in Chapter~\ref{chapter:common_analysis_items}.

\subsection{Trigger Chain}
\label{section:trigger}
Triggering is the selective storage of events due to limiting processing and storage bandwidth. Details on the ATLAS triggering system can be found in Chapter~\ref{chapter:ATLAS}.
Triggering streams each have different cuts and they are tailored for different purposes, using multiple trigger streams with careful re-weighting could maximize the signal trigger efficiency through the use of multiple streams. In the dimuon analysis, three trigger streams are employed for this reason.

\section{Data preparation}
The final result of the strategies presented in this chapter is collected from proton-proton collision data during the ATLAS Run 2 period at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{13}$ TeV from 2016-2018. The preliminary strategy of this chapter is generated from ATLAS full simulation Monte Carlo, besides the $Z > \mu \mu $ sample used. Due to the process\'s low statistics in the ATLAS full simulation, a full-size $Z > \mu \mu$ sample is created through a fast Sherpa and PYTHIA8 combination
generation. Section~\ref{sec:fastsimulation} details the superfast event generation. The MC are used for signal sensitivity test, the binning studies as well as the finalizing the background Gaussian Process hyper-parameters in this analysis. 

\subsection{Samples Used for the Analysis}
The following are the samples used for the analysis. The largest background contribution in this analysis is the $Z > \mu\mu $ process; the second-largest contribution originates from $Z > \tau \tau$. Other processes, including the t-channel $t\bar{t}$ decay, diboson decay as well as top decay contribute a considerable amount to the background events.

\subsubsection{Fast Simulation $Z > \mu\mu$  Samples}
\label{sec:fastsimulation}
Due to the low statistics in the primary background sample in  $Z \> \mu \mu$, fast generation relying on Pythia8 and a smearing function for the detector effect has been used to emulate imperfect resolution of the detector. Four of the superfast statistics as been used, each using a different pdf set for the generator tuning. The nominal set uses the ATLAS A14 NNPDF2.3LO; the down variation and up variation uses the variation tune parameters Var3C described in Ref~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021}; whereas the $\eta$ variation uses ATLAS A15 NNPDF2.3 along with QCD and QED NLO. More details on the fast simulation are given in Ref~\cite{Artoni:2703492}.

%In addition to sources in this table, there are also "fakes" that get misidentifies as muons that can contribute to the background. 
%
%QCD fakes that contribute to the background events are estimated by same-signed dimuon pairs in the data. Since the only source of same-signed dimuon events in the data all originates from QCD fake contribution, the event count would be approximately equal to the opposite-signed contribution of fakes from QCD. Figure~\ref{fig:samesigned} shows a background composition plot with the same signed contribution subtracted out. The fake QCD contribution makes up less
%than 1\% of all the events. After the application of the Fake estimation, the overall agreement between data and MC in controlled regions is within an acceptable range. The MC is ready to be used for statistics strategy studies.

In the analysis, studies were done and it was found that muons of the \textbf{MEDIUM} working point and the \textbf{FixedCutPFlowLoose} isolation working point (Defined in Chapter~\ref{chapter:common_analysis_items}) will provide the maximal muon performance and signal sensitivity. Two muons of at least 4 GeV in transverse momentum and $|\eta|<2.5$ are required for each event. An additional $P_{T}>$ 14GeV cut is applied to events in the boosted channel.

%\subsection{Event Selection}
%Following the above trigger cuts, the following event selections are made on the muons:
%
%\subsubsection*{Muon Working Point}
%The medium working point is chosen for the muons, details to the working point can be found here: 
%
%The choice is made on the medium working point over low PT, as the trigger threshold effectively cut out most muons below 8GeV. The Low PT working point only has a higher efficiency over the medium working point below  6 GeV. 

%\subsubsection*{Isolation Working Point}
%FixedCutPflowLoose is chosen to be the isolation working point, details on the working point description can be found here:~\ref{}. 

%\subsubsection{Fake Estimation}
%Fakes are objects that are not opposite signed dimuon pairs that falls into the selection requirement in data event selection due to misidentifications.
%Since the fakes mainly comes from QCD ATLAS processes, the amount from same signed process and opposite signed process are approximately the same. 
%Fakes in the background sample can be estimated from the same signed leptons in data. Studies found that the content is less than 1\% of all the background contribution. The estimated same signed leptons contribution is added to the MC background composition.

\subsection{Dimuon Mass Spectrum Resolution}
To define the binning of the dimuon mass distribution in the signal region, the dimuon mass resolution is studied. The following study is done on the Z $> \mu \mu$. Details on the procedure can be found in Chapter~\ref{chapter:analysismethod} in Section~\ref{sec:binning}.

Fit of a Gaussian pdf to the distributio of the difference between the true and reconstructed dimuon resonance mass ($m_{\mu\mu_{Truth}} - m_{\mu\mu{Reco}}$) is performed. From the fit, the width of the Gaussian is obtained, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fit}. It is taken to be the detector resolution in the dimuon mass distribution. The bin-by-bin resolution result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sigma}.

\subsection{Binning Strategy}
\label{sec:binningresult}
Using the resolution of the study from the last section and the mass distribution given in the theoretical signal section, the overall binning is chosen to be 0.25 GeV, close to the resolution at the center of the spectrum. Uniform binning simplified the fitting procedure considerably. The choice is also made out of consideration to ensure most of the signals searched for are at least 2 bins wide to reduce the probability of capturing a signal from statistical fluctuation only seen in one bin.

%\subsubsection{MC/Data Comparison}
%A detailed description on the MC/Data comparison test can be found here,\ref{sec:MCData}.

\section{Background Fitting with Gaussian Process}
\label{sec:GPresults}

As the fully simulated ATLAS MC for the background processes listed in table~\ref{table:MC} is neither reliable in shape nor enough in the count. This is due to imperfect shower and hadronization process modelling in the simulation. The effect can be seen in the data/mc comparison in Figure~\ref{fig:datamc}.  The background fitting of the dimuon analysis therefore relies on a data-driven approach. Details on data-driven approaches for smooth background estimation is presented in Section~\ref{sec:backgroundest} of Chapter~\ref{chapter:analysismethod}. The approach used by the dimuon analysis is the Gaussian Process approach outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:GP} of Chapter~\ref{chapter:analysismethod}. Only details specific to the analysis and results are described here.

\subsection{The Kernel}
In Gaussian Process, the mean function prediction and the covariance function on the prediction variance are determined by the kernel function.
The Gaussian Process background and signal kernels used for this particular analysis method are given in Eq.~\ref{eq:backgroundkernel1} and Eq.~\ref{eq:signalkernel1}. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Background Kernel} \textit{-``Radial Basis Function + White Noise Kernel"}
        \begin{equation}
                K_{bkg}(x, x') = A_{1} * exp(-\frac{||x-x'||}{2\sigma_{1}^{2}}) 
        \label{eq:backgroundkernel1}
        \end{equation}

    Here, $A_{1}$ is the amplitude hyperparameter that describes the size of the kernel, $\sigma_{1}$ is the lengthscale parameter.
\item \textbf{Signal Kernel} \textit{- ``Exponential Center Kernel + White Noise Kernel "}
            \begin{equation}
            K(x_{i}, x_{j})=A_{2}\cdot exp(-(x-m)^{2}/(2\cdot\sigma_{2}^{2}))\cdot exp(-((x'-m)^{2}/(2\cdot\sigma_{2}^{2})))
            \label{eq:signalkernel1}
            \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

    Here, $A_{2}$ is the amplitude of the signal kernel, m is the mass location of the signal peak, and $\sigma_{2}$ is the lengthscale of the signal kernel. 

\subsubsection{Test for the Background Kernel}

Although there are noticeable difference between the data and MC, it is believed that the MC along with its different tune variation could still give a good general understandning of what the data shape may look like at unblinding. Verification tests are done to ensure the background MC can be described by the background kernel. The procedure is described as the following: 

To ensure the fit is not biased by the statistical fluctuation, the fit on the spectrum is compared to the fits in the toy distributions. Toy distributions are created from drawing the Poissonian distribution in each bin. 10,000 new toy distributions are formed. Each is fitted with the Gaussian Process background kernel and test statistics defined in Section\ref{teststatistics} are calculated for each fit. The test statistics of the fit to the background MC is compared against the test statistics of
the toy distribution to calculated the p-value(See Eq.~\ref{eq:pvaluetestStats}). Results in Figure~\ref{fig:nominalstats} that all three test statistics tested the p-value is above 0.01 and that the kernel captures features in background distribution well.

\subsection{Hyperparameter Optimization}
The detailed steps to the hyper-parameter optimization can be found in Section~\ref{sec:hyperparam} of Chapter~\ref{chapter:analysismethod}.
The lower bound on the lengthscale of the background kernel and the signal kernel are finalized from the signal injection test result in Section~\ref{sec:signalinjectionresult} and Section~\ref{sec:binningresult} respectively. The other hyper-parameters are allowed to float and are optimized with the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm. 

In the dimuon analysis, the background kernel fits are performed on several distinct variation of the fast simulation MC(See Section~\ref{sec:fastsimulation} to ensure the selected hyper-parameters and lengthscale are flexible enough for the variation possibly present in the final data. Figure~\ref{fig:dimuonmass} shows fitting results in the inclusive region of the MC using the background kernel listed in ~\ref{sec:fastsimulation}. The results show that the lengthscale lower-bound chosen from the signal injection test is flexible enough to provide accurate prediction to MC variations.

\subsection{Background and Signal Estimation}
Background estimation from the background kernel alone was not able to separate the background from the signal to high efficiency. The final background and signal estimation are done through the following separation equations. Figure~\ref{fig:signalseparation} shows an example separation done by the method.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Background Prediction}
    \begin{equation}
        \mu_{bkg}(x_{*}|y) = \mu_{\textrm{bkg kernel}}(x_{*}|y)+K_{\textrm{bkg kernel}}(x_{*}, x) \cdot K_{\textrm{sig+bkg kernel}}(x,x') \cdot( y(x)-\mu_{\textrm{bkg kernel}}(x_{*}|y) )
    \end{equation}


    \item \textbf{Signal Prediction}
    \begin{equation}
        \mu_{sig}(x_{*}|y) = K_{\textrm{sig kernel}}(x_{*}, x)\cdot K_{\textrm{sig+bkg kernel}}(x,x') \cdot ( y(x)-\mu_{\textrm{bkg kernel}}(x_{*}|y) )
    \end{equation}

    Here, $\mu(x_{*}| y) $ is the mean function posterior prediction of of point $x_{*}$, given known data point x and y, K is the kernel. $\mu(x_{*})$ is the prior probability distribution mean. x is a vector of the input mass point, and x' are the same points in a 2d matrix.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Background Prediction Performance Studies}
The Gaussian Process background prediction went through testing suggested in the ATLAS smoothing recommendation document~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2020-028}. to ensure the smooth background procedure is valid for resonance searches. Two tests, the signal injection test and the spurious signal test are conducted to ensure the background estimation is sensitive to signals above a certain size in comparison to the backgroud error. The following subsections show the results of these tests.

\subsubsection{Signal injection test} 
\label{sec:signalinjectionresult}

%\textit{-``Test for smallest signal the background estimation is sensitive to”}
%Start by telling us what you are probing. What question is this examining, how will you examine it, and then tell us the details. 


The aim of the signal injection test is to provide an estimation to the signal sensitivity of the background estimation method. If the background estimation method can discriminate signal of at least 3 times the size of the background estimation statistical uncertainty along the search region mass point, it passes the test. The test is also used to select a lower bound on the lengthscale of the Gaussian Process background kernel in Eq.~\ref{eq:backgroundkernel1}. Only a lower bound lengthscale with the above mentioned sensitivity is used for the analysis.

Details of the procedure of the signal injection test can be found in Ref~\ref{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2020-028}. Only results are presented here.
Results found that a minimum lengthscale of 4 GeV is needed for the background kernel for the background model to be sensitive to signal of 3 $\sigma$ background estimation statistical uncertainty in the 45-68 GeV range in the inclusive region. %Most of the signal width used passed the test when this lengthscale is chosen. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

In the first panel. the red line shows the background MC + signal injected divided by the background MC; the green and the blue line are the fit ratio of the "just above" bumphunter window exclusion(when a window has a bumphunter p-value below 0.01). The "just below" trigger of the bumphunter fit against the background MC. The grey bands shows the width of the background estimation statistical uncertainty. Results shows that the the fit is sensitive to signal $<$ 3 $\sigma$ of the background error in this mass point and width, passing the signal injection test. }

\subsubsection{Background Modelling}
Using the minimal lengthscale chosen from the signal injection test from the above section and allowing other hyperparameters to float, tests fits are performed on the nominal background MC set, and also done on the different statistical variation of the background, the 1 $\sigma$ up and 1 $\sigma$ down variation of the fast simulation Pythia, as well as the $\eta$ variation, defined in Section~\ref{sec:fastsimulation}.
The fitting result shows that lengthscale chosen for Gaussian Process works well for all of these statistical variations.

        These figure illustrates the fit on MC, along with the bumphunter test statistics and the observed value distribution. It is shown that the most discrepant window does not fall below the critical p-value of 0.01. Details on the bumphunting procedure can be found here.

\subsection{Spurious signal test}

The spurious signal test is a test that defines the background estimation uncertainty relative to signal yield. Details are presented in Ref~\ref{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2020-028}. The test is considered passed if the signal extracted versus the background estimation uncertainty ratio is $<$ 0.5. The spurious signal test results on the Gaussian Process are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:spurious}. Currently, ongoing work is being done to further reduce the spurious signal.

\section{Statistics Testing}
Details on the statistical test can be found here in Section~\ref{section:stats}. As of the writing of this thesis, the data have not yet been unblinded. Monte Carlo studies were done to verify the procedure. 

\section{The Search}
The search aims to either accept or reject the null hypothesis. Details are listed in this Section~\ref{sec:thesearch}.

An example of the search is done with just the background and no signal injected is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:searchnull} and another result with an artificially injected signal is shown in ~\ref{fig:searchbump}. The tests are performed as a demonstration of what the result of the unblinded data may look like if it is similar to the background MC, or if an excess is present. 

In the background only MC example, the loglikelihood, the $\chi^{2}$ ,and the bumphunter test statistics all have p-value above 0.01. No anomaly is found and the null hypothesis is accepted.
In the background and signal example, the bumphunter test statistics all have p-value below 0.01. The result indicate an excess could be present.

        }

    \end{center}

Another example of the search done with the background with a toy signal of a Gaussian shape that peaks at 50 GeV. The bumphunter test statistics have p-value below 0.01. The fit result is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:searchbump}. The null hypothesis is rejected.

        \label{fig:searchbump}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

These demonstrations indicate that the statistical pipeline is functioning and ready to be applied to collision data.

\section{Limit Setting}
In the dimuon analysis, the limit setting procedure is done through the Asimov approximation of the frequentist limits described in Section~\ref{sec:limits}. Preliminary limit setting based on Gaussian Process is still currently under test. A limits calculated by approximation based on the fit function method on background only MC are shown here in Figure~\ref{fig:limits}.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
As per 2022-2-27, a presentation of the above result was discussed at the ATLAS statistics forum and it was recommended that the analysis be redone with all the hyper-parameters fixed from the fitting of different variation of fast simulations. Another outstanding item would be implementation of the  Gaussian Process test statistics into the frequentist statistics framework. 
These items are under way.
