Searching for truth and developing knowledge in the process is part of what makes us human. This has been true across different cultures, spaces and time: ancient Greeks philosopher Plato contends there is truth that exists as ideals behind shadows in a cave, ancient chinese philosophers' endlessly debated the truthful nature of human; different streams of Indian philosophers debates and discuss the Satya (loosly translate to truth) and its practice. Knowledge that gets develop advance different technology, allow human to live for longer with greater convenience and provide a deeper understanding on the human nature. 

Human's endeavor for the truth is always to uncover something that is more than what we currently know: Plato saw truth as ideal forms beyond projections of everyday objects; Immanuel Kant saw a distinction between the world of phenomenon and nomenon, the latter describe a part of world that is beyond our senses but describe the fundamental nature of things. 
The ingrained search of truth in human nature shows a fundamental quest to authenticity, and that human can be more than what we believe we are. 

In contemporary times, philosophy no longer treat truth as an ideal like Plato, or mechanical statics like in the early 20th century, but it's nonetheless a human drive to 
Combined with the ideal of subjectivity, French philosopher Alain Badiou has elegantly formulated the logic for the search for truth as "truth procedures". According to his view, Truth is the subsequent statements and discourses that follows from the rupture of an accident calleded the Event. To be human he said, is to take on the accident and pursue them to the end. 

Particle physics is a search for truth in the most elemantary form. It seeks to understand elementary particles and their interactions. Not only is particle physics important as it expands the knowledge of the smallest possible observable universe for human, it's also the building blocks for chemicals, biological cells and therefore concerns most things in the world; particle physics also closely impacted Through which, provide insight to the working of the entire universe, and also what human is made of. 

Particle Physics has enjoyed many sucesses since the founding of the discipline in 1960s, following the development of Quantum Field theory.
Through new experimental findings and new model building techniques developed since, particle physics has established something called the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The theory is a huge sucess, as it made many accurate prediction that was later confirmed by experiment: most notably, the prediction of the W, Z and the Higgs Boson. Human understanding of the interaction between elementary particles has been greatly advanced with the establishment of the Standard Model, though there remain many unresolved questions that shows that the theory is incomplete. 

One major aspect is the dark matter, the standard model of particle physics does not account for dark matter, matter that is believed to make up about 85\% of the the existing universe.  

%The search of truth is the uncovering of facade in front for authenticity and admitting of our ignorance, there is something more than what we currently know to be uncovered:  
% As Martin Heidigger would put it. 

%Plato in his allegory of the cave illustrates truth as ideal forms behind the shadows that human sees.
The search of truth is an act of authenticity

Truth is no longer viewed as a static, but still something that human strive to get close to in our different endeavour in the realm of particle . 
In search for the strange little resonances, ooking for such rupture in the truth fabric, 

Searching for truth is the search for that there is more than what is before us.

Extending the frontier to what human know 

Particle physics is the study of the most fundamental particles in the universe and their interaction. It's at the boundary of what it's known

This thesis focuses on a series of searches done over resonance hunting 
they are well motivated initially on the dark matter model, which is detailed in chapter . 

Chapter discuss and review resonance hunting over smooth background, and give a discussion on how it is possible to look for new particle in dark matter model and beyond with this method.
Literature on this will be further discussed and some pilot studies on the different methods of looking for new particle is reviewed here. Some inital dimuon results is shown.

An introduction to why what we are is more than, the overview of standard model strive to give an account for the history of the standard model of particle physics, 
In search of truth, theory is perfected in the process, and that it is in this process that we gain tools to look for further truth.
It's possible for human to be more than what we know. We are more than what we are.
