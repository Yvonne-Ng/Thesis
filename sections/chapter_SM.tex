\section{History}
    The Standard Model of Particle Physics describes the best human understanding to elementary particles and their interaction to-date. It describes three fundamental forces, 
    The Standard Model of particle physics describes most fundamental particles to human understanding particles. and their interaction dynamics, it describes three fundamental forces (the weak, the electro-magnetic and the strong force, neglecting gravity). It has a total of 19 particles, 
    Historically, it 

    * historically, how it was developed
    * its sucesses, its predictions lead to W,Z, Higgs boson
    * some phenomenon is unexplained, 
    not the most fundamental complete theory 
    * baryon asymmetry/gravitation theory
    * expansion of the universe 
    * Dark matter
    * Neutrino oscillation or their non-zero mass

    Paradigm of Quantum field theory, and is the basis where consequent theories in the standard model is based on. 

    History that lead to the standard model
    What is the standard model 
1. Electro-Weak theory
    Q.E.D.
    Dirac and the problem of annihilation of anti-particle lead to the second quantization, with work from 
    Second quantization

    Gauge theory
    The unification of eletro-dynamic force and the weak force
    The Higgs Mechanism / spontaneous symmetry breaking 


4. Quantum Chromodynamics
    Yang-Mill theory, non-abelian gauge groups.

6. Unresolved Probelms in the Standard Model
-Gravity
-cannot describe atom level in QCD
-Hierarchy problem 
    *Order 1, 2 and 4.

Standard model is the corner stone and a starting point in the journey to particle discoveries.
