      abstract     = {This article documents the muon reconstruction and
                      identification efficiency obtained by the ATLAS experiment
                      for 139 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13$
                      TeV collected between 2015 and 2018 during Run 2 of the LHC.
                      The increased instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC
                      over this period required a reoptimisation of the criteria
                      for the identification of prompt muons. Improved and newly
                      developed algorithms were deployed to preserve high muon
                      identification efficiency with a low misidentification rate
                      and good momentum resolution. The availability of large
                      samples of $Z\to\mu\mu$ and $J/\psi\to\mu\mu$ decays, and
                      the minimisation of systematic uncertainties, allows the
                      efficiencies of criteria for muon identification, primary
                      vertex association, and isolation to be measured with an
                      accuracy at the per-mille level in the bulk of the phase
                      space, and up to the percent level in complex kinematic
                      configurations. Excellent performance is achieved over a
                      range of transverse momenta from 3 GeV to several hundred
                      GeV, and across the full muon detector acceptance of
                      $|\eta|<2.7$.},
